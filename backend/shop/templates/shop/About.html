				<p>Too be written: So here are the lyrics to fresh prince of Bel Air: 
					Now this is a story all about how
					My life got flipped-turned upside down
					And I'd like to take a minute
					Just sit right there
					I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

					In west Philadelphia born and raised
					On the playground was where I spent most of my days
					Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
					And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
					When a couple of guys who were up to no good
					Started making trouble in my neighborhood
					I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
					She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air."

					I begged and pleaded with her day after day
					But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
					She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
					I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it."

					First class, yo, this is bad
					Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
					Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
					Hmm, this might be alright.

					But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
					Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
					I don't think so
					I'll see when I get there
					I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

					Well, the plane landed and when I came out
					There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
					I ain't trying to get arrested yet
					I just got here
					I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

					I whistled for a cab and when it came near
					The license plate said "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror
					If anything I could say that this cab was rare
					But I thought, "Nah, forget it."
					â€“ "Yo, home to Bel-Air."

					I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
					And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo home smell ya later."
					I looked at my kingdom
					I was finally there
					To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air
